SimpleGraph
===========

A simple and easy to use (though not necessarily optimal) graph library that can be used to implement fundamental graph algorithms like BFS tree construction and DFS forests. This library supports both directed and undirected graphs. Graphs are read through a tab separated plain text file.

For now, run the following.

$python graph.py
